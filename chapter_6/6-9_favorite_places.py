# Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three
# names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for
# each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to
# name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each
# personâ€™s name and their favorite places
